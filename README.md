# About this application

This application has been created to show how to use the Angular Material Components library togehter with Angular.
But since the Angular Material Components are not responsive by design, I used the Angular Flex-Layout package to
make the application responsive.

## How to run the application

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `ng serve`
